## bsitar

The **bsitar** package provides an interface for Bayesian implementation of
Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) growth model. The SITAR is
a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits a natural cubic spline
mean curve and aligns individual-specific growth curves to the underlying
mean curve via a set of random effects: the size, timing and intensity. The
**bsitar** package package is a front-end to the R package **brms** which uses 
the **Stan** program (see https://mc-stan.org/) to performing full Bayesian
inference for a range of regression specifications including hierarchical
multivariate modeling.
