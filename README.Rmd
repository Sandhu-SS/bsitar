## Overview

The **bsitar** package provides an interface for Bayesian implementation of the
Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) growth model. The SITAR is
a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits a natural cubic spline
mean curve and aligns individual-specific growth curves to the underlying mean
curve via a set of random effects: size, timing and intensity. The
**bsitar** package package is a front-end to the R package **brms** which itself uses the **Stan** program to performing full Bayesian inference.


## Installation

To install the latest release version from CRAN use

```{r install_bsitar, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bsitar")
```

The current developmental version can be installed from GitHub as:

```{r install_bsitar2, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("Sandhu-SS/bsitar")
```

The **brms** package can be installed from the CRAN 

```{r install_brms, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("brms")
```

The latest developmental version of **brms** can be downloaded from GitHub as follows

```{r install_brms2, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("paul-buerkner/brms")
```


Note that the *brms*, and hence the *bsitar* too, are based on Stan, and therefore a C++ compiler is required. The program Rtools
(available on https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) comes with a C++
compiler for Windows. On Mac, you should install Xcode. For further instructions
on how to get the compilers running, see the prerequisites section on
https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started.
