# bsitar (development version)

### Bugfixes

- bsitar(): The 'sigma_cov_init_beta = random' argument was setting wrong initial values for the covariates  
  included in the 'sigma' formula. The initials for Intercept ('sigma_init_beta') were used for covariates too.
- bsitar(): For 'univariate_by' model, the subset indicators were set as numeric '1' and '0' rather than         
  explicitly setting them to logical TRUE/FALSE. 


### Miscellaneous
- Replaced Bayesian SITAR model fit shown as example from 'berkeley_mfit' applied to 20 randomly selected males   between 6 and 20 years of age ('berkeley_mdata') with 'berkeley_exfit' that is fit to 70 females between 8 and 20 years of age ('berkeley_exdata'). This is done to use the example model ('berkeley_exfit') in vignette that provide a detailed comparison between non Bayesian SITAR model fit (using the 'sitar' package) and Bayesian SITAR model fit (using the 'bsitar' package). The vignette included in the 'sitar' package analysed the exact same data (70 females between 8 and 20 years of age). 
- Now user need not to set environment as 'globalenv()' i.e., ```envir = globalenv()``` for post processing functions. The environment is now automatically set to match the environment of exposed functions. It is important to note that setting environment manually (via the 'envir' argument) may actually result in errors. The 'envir' argument is now mostly for internal use only which is needed during tests. 
- Minor corrections/changes to make R code more efficient.


# bsitar 0.1.1

### New feature

- Added 'optimize_model' function to perform model optimization by fitting 
  model with varying degree of freedom and by transforming 'x' (predictor) 
  and 'y' (outcome) varibales. The allowed transformations for 'x' and 'y' 
  variables are 'log' (logarithmic) and 'sqrt' (square root) transformation. 
  The 'optimize_model' performs comparison of resulting model fits based on 
  user specified  criteria such as the Watanabeâ€“Akaike information criterion
  ('waic'), leave-one-out cross-validation ('loo') and the Bayesian R square 
  ('bayes_R2'). Please see help file of 'optimize_model' to see documentation.

### Minor changes

- Updated documentation
- Added vignette about the Bayesian SITAR model fit to height data (univariate model)
- Added issue tracker url: https://github.com/Sandhu-SS/bsitar/issues


### Bugfixes

- plot_curves(): Fixed bug to remove warning "Duplicated aesthetics after name 
standardisation: group in when plotting together unadjusted and adjusted curves." 
- plot_curves(): Fixed bug to remove palettes error when tried plotting all 
four curves together (distance, velocity, adjusted and unadjusted)
- plot_curves(): and growthparameters() fixed issues relating to not using 
'dplyr::all_of()' when within the 'dplyr::select()'


### Miscellaneous
- Added more utility functions for internal use (for consistency and efficiency) 
- Minor corrections/changes to make R code more efficient and consistent across sub modules.
