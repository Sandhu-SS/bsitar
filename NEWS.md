# bsitar (development version)

### Bugfixes

- bsitar(): The 'sigma_cov_init_beta = random' sets wrong initial values for covariates included in the 'sigma' formula. The initials for Intercept ('sigma_init_beta') were used for covariates too.
- bsitar(): For 'univariate_by' model, the subset indicators were set as numeric '1' and '0' rather than explicitly setting them to logical TRUE/FALSE. 


### Miscellaneous
- Changed Bayesian SITAR model fit shown as example from 'berkeley_mfit' (SITAR model fit to 20 randomly selected males between 6 and 20 years of age) to 'berkeley_ffit' (SITAR model fit to 70 females between 8 and 20 years of age). This is done to use sample model fit ('berkeley_ffit') in vigenette that provide a detailed compariosn between non Bayesian SITAR model fit (using the 'sitar' package) and Bayesian SITAR model fit (using the 'bsitar' package). The vigenette included in the 'sitar' package analysed the exact same data (70 females between 8 and 20 years of age). 
- Minor corrections/changes to make R code more efficient and consistent across sub modules.


# bsitar 0.1.1

### New feature

- Added 'optimize_model' function to perform model optimization by fitting 
  model with varying degree of freedom and by transforming 'x' (predictor) 
  and 'y' (outcome) varibales. The allowed transformations for 'x' and 'y'    
  variables are 'log' (logarithmic) and 'sqrt' (square root) transformation. 
  The 'optimize_model' performs comparison of resulting model fits based on 
  user specified  criteria such as the Watanabeâ€“Akaike information criterion
  ('waic'), leave-one-out cross-validation ('loo') and the Bayesian R square 
  ('bayes_R2'). Please see help file of 'optimize_model' to see documentation.

### Minor changes

- Updated documentation
- Added vignette about the Bayesian SITAR model fit to height data (univariate model)
- Added issue tracker url: https://github.com/Sandhu-SS/bsitar/issues


### Bugfixes

- plot_curves(): Fixed bug to remove warning "Duplicated aesthetics after name 
standardisation: group in when plotting together unadjusted and adjusted curves." 
- plot_curves(): Fixed bug to remove palettes error when tried plotting all 
four curves together (distance, velocity, adjusted and unadjusted)
- plot_curves(): and growthparameters() fixed issues relating to not using 
'dplyr::all_of()' when within the 'dplyr::select()'


### Miscellaneous
- Added more utility functions for internal use (for consistency and efficiency) 
- Minor corrections/changes to make R code more efficient and consistent across sub modules.
