Description: Bayesian implementation of univariate and multivariate Super
    Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) growth models. The
    univariate version of the SITAR model can be fit within the frequentist framework by using the
    already available package 'sitar'. The SITAR is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits a natural
    cubic spline mean curve and and aligns individual-specific growth curves to the mean cuvre via a set of random effects on both
    effects. For more information, see Cole et al.
    (2010) <doi: 10.1093/ije/dyq115>. The 'bsitar' package is a front-end
    to the R package 'brms' which facilitates a range of regression
    specifications including hierarchical and multivariate modeling and
    also provides an excellent framework for post-processing.
