Description: Bayesian implementation of Super Imposition by Translation  
    and Rotation (SITAR) model to analyze growth data with single outcome  
    (e.g., height)  and joint modelling of multiple outcomes (multivariate 
    model) such as height  and weight. The non Bayesian version of the 
    SITAR model (for a single response variable) can be fit by using an 
    already available R package 'sitar'. The SITAR is a shape-invariant 
    nonlinear mixed effect model that fits a natural cubic spline mean 
    curve and and aligns individual-specific growth curves to the mean 
    curve via a set of random effects on both effects. For more information, 
    please see Cole (2010)  <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115>. The 'bsitar' package   
    is a front-end to  the R package 'brms' which facilitates a range of  
    regression specifications including hierarchical multivariate modeling and 
    also provides an excellent framework for post-processing.
