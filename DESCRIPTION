Description: Bayesian implementation of univariate and multivariate Super
    Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) growth models. The
    univariate version of the SITAR model can be fit within the
    frequentist framework by using the already available package 'sitar'.
    The SITAR is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits
    a natural cubic spline mean curve and and aligns individual-specific
    growth curves to the mean curve via a set of random effects on both
    effects. For more information, see Cole (2010) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115>. 
    The 'bsitar' package is a front-end to  the R package 'brms' which 
    facilitates a range of regression specifications including hierarchical 
    multivariate modeling and also provides an excellent framework for 
    post-processing.
