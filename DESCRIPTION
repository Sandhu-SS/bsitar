Description: Bayesian implementation of Super Imposition by Translation and 
    Rotation (SITAR) model to analyze growth data with single outcome (e.g., height)  
    and joint modelling of multiple outcomes (multivariate model) such as height 
    and weight. The non Bayesian version of the SITAR model (for a single response  
    variable)  can be fit by using the already available R package 'sitar'.
    The SITAR is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits
    a natural cubic spline mean curve and and aligns individual-specific
    growth curves to the mean curve via a set of random effects on both
    effects. For more information, see Cole (2010) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115>. 
    The 'bsitar' package is a front-end to  the R package 'brms' which 
    facilitates a range of regression specifications including hierarchical 
    multivariate modeling and also provides an excellent framework for 
    post-processing.
