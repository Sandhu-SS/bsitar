Description: Bayesian implementation of univariate and multivariate Super
    Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) growth models. The
    frequentist version of univariate SITAR model can be fit by using the
    'sitar' package.  The SITAR is a shape-invariant model with a natural
    cubic spline mean curve and subject-specific random effects on both
    the measurement and age scales. For more information, see Cole
    (2010) <doi: 10.1093/ije/dyq115>. The 'bsitar' package is a front-end
    to the R package 'brms', which facilitates a range of regression
    specifications including hierarchical and multivariate modeling and
    provides an excellent framework for post-processing.
