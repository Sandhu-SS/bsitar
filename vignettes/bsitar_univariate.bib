    abstract = "{Background Growth curve analysis is a statistical issue in life course epidemiology. Height in puberty involves a growth spurt, the timing and intensity of which varies between individuals. Such data can be summarized with individual Preece–Baines (PB) curves, and their five parameters then related to earlier exposures or later outcomes. But it involves fitting many curves.Methods We present an alternative SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation (SITAR) model, a shape invariant model with a single fitted curve. Curves for individuals are matched to the mean curve by shifting their curve up–down (representing differences in mean size) and left–right (for differences in growth tempo), and the age scale is also shrunk or stretched to indicate how fast time passes in the individual (i.e. velocity). These three parameters per individual are estimated as random effects while fitting the curve. The outcome is a mean curve plus triplets of parameters per individual (size, tempo and velocity) that summarize the individual growth patterns. The data are heights for Christ’s Hospital School (CHS) boys aged 9–19 years (N = 3245, n = 129 508), and girls with Turner syndrome (TS) aged 9–18 years from the UK Turner Study (N = 105, n = 1321).Results The SITAR model explained 99\\% of the variance in both datasets [residual standard deviation (RSD) 6–7 mm], matching the fit of individually-fitted PB curves. In CHS, growth tempo was associated with insulin-like growth factor-1 measured 50 years later (P = 0.01, N = 1009). For the girls with TS randomized to receive oxandrolone from 9 years, velocity was substantially increased compared with placebo (P = 10−8).Conclusions The SITAR growth curve model is a useful epidemiological instrument for the analysis of height in puberty.}",

   abstract = {Models for infant growth have usually been based on parametric forms, commonly an exponential or similar model, which have been shown to fit poorly especially during the first year of life. An alternative approach is to use a non-parametric model, based on a shape invariant model (SIM), where a single function is transformed by shifting and scaling to fit each subject. In the model a regression spline is used as the function, with log transformation of the data and a simplification of the SIM, obtained from the relationship with the exponential model. All subjects are fitted as a nonlinear mixed effects model, allowing the variation in the parameters between subjects to be determined. Methods for the inclusion of covariates in growth models based on SIM are developed, with parameters for time independent covariates included in the model by varying either the shape, the size parameter or the growth parameter and time-dependent co-variates included by transforming the time axis, to either increase or decrease the growth rate dependent on the co-variate, similar to methods used for accelerated failure-time models. The model is used to fit weight data for 602 infants, measured from 0 to 2 years as part of the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study (CAPS) trial, and to determine the effect of breastfeeding on infant weight.

   abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods are becoming ever more popular in applied and fundamental research. In this study a gentle introduction to Bayesian analysis is provided. It is shown under what circumstances it is attractive to use Bayesian estimation, and how to interpret properly the results. First, the ingredients underlying Bayesian methods are introduced using a simplified example. Thereafter, the advantages and pitfalls of the specification of prior knowledge are discussed. To illustrate Bayesian methods explained in this study, in a second example a series of studies that examine the theoretical framework of dynamic interactionism are considered. In the Discussion the advantages and disadvantages of using Bayesian statistics are reviewed, and guidelines on how to report on Bayesian statistics are provided.},
